[GENIE3](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012776) Developed originally for bulk transcriptional data.  
GENIE3 computes the regulatory network for each gene independently base on Regression trees and tree ensemble. This method was the top performer in the DREAM4 in silico network challenge (multifactorial subchallenge).  
### pre-requests of input data  
Count matrix is ok.   
This method will first normalized the gene expressions so that they all have a unit variance in the training set.
